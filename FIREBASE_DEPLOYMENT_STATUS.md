# Firebase Deployment Status

## Current Status

### ✅ Customer Portal - DEPLOYED
- **URL**: https://lr-subscriber-portal.web.app
- **Status**: Live and accessible
- **Configuration**: Updated to use Firebase Functions API endpoint
- **Environment**: Production build with proper API URL

### ❌ Firebase Functions - FAILED
- **Status**: Deployment failed due to build service account permissions
- **Issue**: Missing permissions on the build service account
- **Error**: Build failed with status: FAILURE
- **Alternative**: Need to use different hosting solution for API

## What's Working

1. **Customer Portal Frontend**: Fully deployed and accessible
2. **Firebase Hosting**: Configured for both portal and admin sites
3. **Environment Configuration**: Portal configured to use Functions API

## Current Issue

The deployed portal is trying to connect to:
```
https://us-central1-lr-subscriber-portal.cloudfunctions.net/api
```

But the Firebase Functions deployment is failing due to TypeScript errors in the copied API files.

## Immediate Solution

The portal has been updated with a production environment file that points to the Firebase Functions URL. Once the functions deploy successfully, the CORS issue will be resolved.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Functions Deployment**: Currently in progress
2. **Test Portal Functionality**: Verify login and API calls work
3. **Deploy Admin Portal**: Set up second Firebase site for admin
4. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up Stripe keys and other secrets

## Temporary Workaround

If functions deployment fails, we can:
1. Keep the local API server running for development
2. Use a different hosting solution for the API (like Vercel or Railway)
3. Simplify the functions code to just handle basic auth endpoints

## Files Modified

- `apps/portal/.env.production` - Added Firebase Functions API URL
- `functions/src/index.ts` - Simplified API endpoints
- `functions/package.json` - Disabled linting for deployment

## Testing

Once functions are deployed, test:
1. Visit https://lr-subscriber-portal.web.app
2. Try to login with any email + 6-digit code
3. Verify no CORS errors in browser console
